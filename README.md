# prime_numbers_generator
This script is part of my practice on generators.
The program asks for an integer, takes a numeric interval from 0 to the given number and yields the primes number included in the interval.
The goal was to start a generator that yields the results and let the user generate one result at the time.

I hope you find this script useful and please feel free to let me know your opinion and ideas to improve this program. 
Cheers.
